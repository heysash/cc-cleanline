# CC CleanLine - Clean Claude Code Status Line

A clean, minimalist status line script for Claude Code that embodies the clean code philosophy - clear, readable, purposeful. Designed for developers who value distraction-free, professional status information.

## Philosophy

CC CleanLine follows the clean code philosophy: **every element serves a purpose, nothing is superfluous**. No decorative clutter, no visual noise - just the essential information you need, presented clearly and professionally.

This isn't just about looking good (though it does) - it's about cognitive clarity. When your status line is clean and purposeful, your mind stays focused on what matters: your code.

## Features

🧹 **Clean & Minimalist** - Zero visual clutter, maximum information clarity  
⚙️ **Configurable** - Fully customizable via `cc-cleanline.config.sh`  
🔮 **Future-Proof** - Designed for extensibility and layout variations  
🧠 **Intelligent** - Smart session token monitoring and real-time cost tracking  
🎯 **Focused** - 3-line output: Git + Directory / Login + Model + Time / Tokens + API Costs  
🌈 **Color-Coded** - Model-specific colors (Sonnet=saddlebrown, Opus=sandybrown)  
📊 **Cost Tracking** - Accurate daily totals and session costs via ccusage integration  
🔄 **Git Integration** - Branch detection with real uncommitted changes (+lines/-lines)  
⚡ **Session Tokens** - 5h Max Tokens tracking with Low/Medium/High thresholds  

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heysash/cc-cleanline.git
   cd cc-cleanline
   ```

2. Make executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x cc-cleanline.sh
   ```

3. Configure Claude Code (see Configuration section)

## Configuration

### Claude Code Settings

**macOS**: `~/.claude/settings.json`

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bash /path/to/cc-cleanline/cc-cleanline.sh"
  }
}
```

### Customization

CC CleanLine uses a two-tier configuration system for flexible customization:

#### Default Configuration
The base configuration is in `cc-cleanline.config.sh` which contains all default settings and gets updated when you pull new versions.

#### Personal Overrides  
Create `cc-cleanline.config.local` to override specific settings without affecting the base configuration. This file:
- Is automatically ignored by git (stays local)
- Only needs the variables you want to change
- Takes precedence over default values

**Setup your personal config:**

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp cc-cleanline.config.example cc-cleanline.config.local
   ```

2. Edit `cc-cleanline.config.local` and uncomment/modify any values:
   ```bash
   # Example personal overrides
   COLOR_ACTIVE_STATUS='\033[94m'        # Blue instead of green
   SHOW_FULL_PATH=true                   # Show full directory paths
   ICON_ACTIVE="►"                       # Different active icon
   LABEL_MODEL="Model"                   # Custom model label
   ```

#### Available Settings
- **Colors**: Status states, model colors, UI elements
- **Icons**: Status indicators (●, ○, ⚠, ✓)  
- **Labels**: Login status, context messages, model names
- **Display**: Path format, cost visibility, feature toggles

The local config only needs variables you want to change - all others use the defaults.

## Output Examples

**Active development session:**

```text
● git branch main (+15/-3) ▶ ./project
● Logged-In ★ LLM Opus 4.1 ⏱ Next Session 2h 43m  
  ● 5h Max Tokens Low ⚡API Costs Included
```

**Outside git repo:**

```text
○ no git repository ▶ ./scratch
○ Not logged in ☆ LLM Sonnet 4 ⏱ Next Session 1h 15m
  ⚡API $3.80 (current session)
```

### Clean Color Scheme

- **Bright Green** (active states): git branch, logged in, Low token usage
- **Orange** (Medium token usage): matches current model color for consistency
- **Red** (attention states): no git, logged out, High token usage  
- **Sandybrown**: ★ Opus 4.1 model
- **Saddlebrown**: ☆ Sonnet 4 model
- **Standard Gray**: Directory paths, times, costs, neutral text

## Requirements

### Required

- Bash shell
- `jq` for JSON parsing  
- Claude Code CLI

### Optional

- `git` for branch detection
- `bunx`/`npx` for ccusage cost tracking

## Technical Details

- **Session Token Tracking**: Monitors 5h session token usage with Low/Medium/High thresholds and model-matched colors
- **Cost Tracking**: Integrates with [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) for accurate daily totals and current session costs with improved precision using jq
- **Time Display**: Shows remaining session time from ccusage active block or fallback calculation
- **Git Integration**: Automatic branch detection with real uncommitted changes only (+lines/-lines)
- **Configuration**: Hot-reloadable via `cc-cleanline.config.sh` with cost display options
- **Output Format**: Consistent 3-line layout for reliable parsing

## Experimental Features 🐰

*"Curiouser and curiouser..." - Alice*

Some say there are hidden pathways in the configuration files, waiting for the truly curious developer to discover them. What secrets lie behind innocent-looking settings? What happens when boredom meets code?

> *Follow the white rabbit...*  
> *The rabbit hole goes deeper than you think.*

For those who dare to explore beyond the clean facade, remember: not all features are documented, and not all documentation tells the whole truth. Sometimes the most delightful discoveries come from reading between the lines... or perhaps from a simple boolean that asks "What's this?" 

*The Matrix has CC CleanLine, and CC CleanLine has you.*

---

**Hint for the sleepless coders:** The configuration holds more than colors and labels. Those who work past midnight might find unexpected companions in their status line. Easter eggs are not just for Sunday.
